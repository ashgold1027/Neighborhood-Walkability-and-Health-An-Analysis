The United States of America has the highest amount of obesity of any country in the world. The U.S. is also notorious for having towns that lack walkability and are reliant on cars instead. The goal of this data analysis is to see whether factors that influence an environmentâ€™s walkability can be changed to help reduce obesity and increase physical activity, and then to see which income and race demographics would benefit the most from these changes. This analysis can inform possible intiatives to improve public health and help us know which groups to target these initiatives to.

Two sets of data will be used for this analysis, both of which were collected by the U.S. government. One data table is about the nutrition of various demographics in the U.S. (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system), and the other data table is on Walkability in each tract of the U.S. (https://gis.cancer.gov/research/files.html). The walkability data was collected in 2013.
